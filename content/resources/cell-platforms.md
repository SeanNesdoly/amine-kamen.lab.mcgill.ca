# **Cell-based Expression Platforms**

Our strategic focus regarding expression platforms is mainly centered around
eukaryotic cell-based systems, namely HEK293, VERO cells, and insect-derived
cell lines used in the baculoviral expression system. The relevance of these
platforms resides in their widespread use within the industrial sector.
