The Vero cell line is the most widely used continuous cell line for the
production of viral vaccines, including those against influenza, Japanese
encephalitis, polio, and rabies, amongst others. The original Vero cell line was
derived in 1962 from the kidney of an African green monkey. The cells are
interferon deficient, which could explain their permissiveness to viral
infection.
