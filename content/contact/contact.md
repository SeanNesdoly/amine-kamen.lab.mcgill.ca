Established in 2012, the [Department of
Bioengineering](https://mcgill.ca/bioengineering/)is the newest department to
join McGill Universityâ€™s renowned [Faculty of
Engineering](https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/). McGill researchers from nearly
all Faculty units, including seven Canada Research Chairs and many colleagues in
the Faculties of Medicine, Science, and Agriculture and Environmental Sciences
are actively involved in various areas of Bioengineering. Within our Department,
the faculty are focusing on three major directions: biological materials and
mechanics; biomolecular and cellular engineering; and biomedical, diagnostics
and high throughput screening.
