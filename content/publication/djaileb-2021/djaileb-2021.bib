 abstractnote = {We report on the development
of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors and matching ELISAs for the detection
of nucleocapsid and spike antibodies specific against the novel coronavirus 2019
(SARS-CoV-2) in human serum, plasma and dried blood spots (DBS). When exposed to
SARS-CoV-2 or a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the immune system responds by
expressing antibodies at levels that can be detected and monitored to identify
the fraction of the population potentially immunized against SARS-CoV-2 and
support efforts to deploy a vaccine strategically. A SPR sensor coated with a
peptide monolayer and functionalized with various sources of SARS-CoV-2
recombinant proteins expressed in different cell lines detected human
anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the nanomolar range. Nucleocapsid expressed in different
cell lines did not significantly change the sensitivity of the assays, whereas
the use of a CHO cell line to express spike ectodomain led to excellent
performance. This bioassay was performed on a portable SPR instrument capable of
measuring 4 biological samples within 30 minutes of sample/sensor contact and
the chip could be regenerated at least 9 times. Multi-site validation was then
performed with in-house and commercial ELISA, which revealed excellent
cross-correlations with Pearsonâ€™s coefficients exceeding 0.85 in all cases, for
measurements in DBS and plasma. This strategy paves the way to point-of-care and
rapid testing for antibodies in the context of viral infection and vaccine
efficacy monitoring.},
