abstract: "Abstract Despite rapid progress in the field, scalable high-yield production of adeno-associated virus (AAV) is still one of the critical bottlenecks the manufacturing sector is facing. The insect cell-baculovirus expression vector system (IC-BEVS) has emerged as a mainstream platform for the scalable production of recombinant proteins with clinically approved products for human use. In this review, we provide a detailed overview of the advancements in IC-BEVS for rAAV production. Since the first report of baculovirus-induced production of rAAV vector in insect cells in 2002, this platform has undergone significant improvements, including enhanced stability of Bac-vector expression and a reduced number of baculovirus-coinfections. The latter streamlining strategy led to the eventual development of the Two-Bac, One-Bac, and Mono-Bac systems. The one baculovirus system consisting of an inducible packaging insect cell line was further improved to enhance the AAV vector quality and potency. In parallel, the implementation of advanced manufacturing approaches and control of critical processing parameters have demonstrated promising results with process validation in large-scale bioreactor runs. Moreover, optimization of the molecular design of vectors to enable higher cell-specific yields of functional AAV particles combined with bioprocess intensification strategies may also contribute to addressing current and future manufacturing challenges."
