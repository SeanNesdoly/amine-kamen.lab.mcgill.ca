 abstract = {Lentiviral vectors (LVs) are a powerful tool for gene and cell
therapy and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) have been extensively used as
a platform for production of these vectors. Like most cells and cellular
tissues, HEK293 cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs released by
cells share similar size, biophysical characteristics and even a biogenesis
pathway with cell-produced enveloped viruses, making it a challenge to
efficiently separate EVs from LVs. Thus, EVs co-purify with LVs during
downstream processing, becoming “impurities” in the context of cell therapy. To
characterize EVs from an inducible lentivirus producing cell line, two
conditions were studied: non-induced and induced. EVs’ identity was confirmed by
transmission electron microscopy and western blot. Seven proteins were
identified by mass spectrometry as potential EV markers. Lipid composition of
EVs and LVs showed similar enrichment in phosphatidylserine. RNA cargos in EVs
showed enrichment in genes involved in viral processes and binding functions.
Flow virometry, GTA and ddPCR results also confirmed the heterogenic nature of
EVs and LVs populations. These findings provide insights on the product profile
of lentiviral preparation and could help develop separation strategies of
co-produced EVs.},
