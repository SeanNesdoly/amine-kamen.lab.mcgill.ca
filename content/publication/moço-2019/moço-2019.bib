(CAR) is an emerging and promising treatment against refractory cancers.
However, the currently adopted methods of modification of T cells pose a
risk of insertional oncogenesis because lentiviral and retroviral
vectors integrate the CAR transgene in a semi-random fashion. In
addition, this therapy is only available using autologous cells, which
create problems in production and limit the access for patients who had
their T cells depleted. One modification method that shows the ability
to overcome both drawbacks is the knock-in of the CAR simultaneously
knocking-out genes that prevent allogeneic therapy, such as the
endogenous T cell receptor. In this mini-review, we present recent
efforts to develop safer universal CAR-T cells. More specifically, we
focus on the combined application of target-directed nucleases, which
create a double-strand break at a specific genome locus, and the
delivery of CAR DNA via adeno-associated viral vectors for subsequent
integration via homologous recombination and silencing of the targeted
gene. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved},
