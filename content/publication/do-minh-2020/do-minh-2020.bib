 abstract = {The production of lentiviral vectors (LVs) in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells using serum-free medium in a suspension culture for the transduction of chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T) can be achieved by different methods. This chapter describes LV production by transient transfection, induction of stable packaging cell lines, and induction of stable producer cell lines.},
