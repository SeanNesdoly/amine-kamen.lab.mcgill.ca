abstract: "Cell-derived influenza vaccines provide better protection and a host
of other advantages compared to the egg-derived vaccines that currently dominate
the market, but their widespread use is hampered by a lack of high yield, low
cost production platforms. Identification and knockout of innate immune and
metabolic restriction factors within relevant host cell lines used to grow the
virus could offer a means to substantially increase vaccine yield. In this
paper, we describe and validate a novel genome-wide pooled CRISPR/Cas9 screening
strategy that incorporates a reporter virus and a FACS selection step to
identify and rank restriction factors in a given vaccine production cell line.
Using the HEK-293SF cell line and A/PuertoRico/8/1934 H1N1 influenza as a model,
we identify 64 putative influenza restriction factors to direct the creation of
high yield knockout cell lines. In addition, gene ontology and protein complex
enrichment analysis of this list of putative restriction factors offers broader
insights into the primary host cell determinants of viral yield in cell-based
vaccine production systems. Overall, this work will advance efforts to address
the public health burden posed by influenza."
