Adenoviral, adeno-associated, baculovirus, and lentiviral vectors are
representative of a broad range of viral structures, morphologies and functions;
as such, they represent different engineering and manufacturing challenges. By
solving key scientific and engineering questions at different scales, a
multi-dimensional bioengineering approach will lead to the development of fully
integrated processes for viral vector productions.
