Adenoviral, adenoassociated and baculovirus vectors are representative of a
broad range of viral structures, morphologies and functions; as such, they
represent different engineering and manufacturing challenges. By solving key
scientific and engineering questions at different scales, a multi-dimensional
bioengineering approach leads to the development of fully integrated processes
for viral vector productions.
