# **Research**

The _Viral Vectors and Vaccines Bioprocessing_ group of [Professor Kamen]({{< ref
"/authors/amine-kamen/_index.md" >}}) is examining how the viral vaccine
production process can be accelerated by understanding how cells and viruses
interact, as well as the cellular metabolic state needed for maximum
productivity. This understanding will help develop the processes and
technologies needed to make safe, potent, cost-effective vaccines.

Our research team is building capacity in viral-based treatments and
preventions, and supporting the translation of discoveries in vaccines and gene
therapy. Our work could lead to developing and commercializing vaccines and
immunotherapies that will significantly improve Canadiansâ€™ health.
