I joined the department of Bioengineering in 2013 after a long and successful
career as the Principal Research Officer of the bioprocessing and manufacturing
vaccine program at the Biotechnology Research Institute, part of the National
Research Council of Canada, where I mainly focused on improving existing and
developing new platforms for the production of recombinant products of
therapeutic interest for both animal and human consumption. I am also dedicated
to training and supervisng human qualified personnel at all academic levels with
a particular interest in encouraging a close interaction with the industrial
sector.

I currently teaching the following courses: 

- [BIEN 590 Cell Culture Engineering](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2018-2019/courses/bien-590)
- [BIEN 340: Transport Processes in Biological Systems](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2018-2019/courses/bien-340)
