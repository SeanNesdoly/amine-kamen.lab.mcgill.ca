Amine Kamen is Professor of Bioengineering at McGill University, and Canada
Research Chair tier-1 in Bioprocessing of Viral Vaccines. He was recently
nominated Researcher Emeritus of the National Research Council of Canada. He was
until early 2014, head of the Process Development section of the Human Health
Therapeutics Portfolio and Lead of the Bioprocessing and Manufacturing of the
Vaccine Program at the National Research Council of Canada. He received a Ph.D.
in Chemical Engineering from École des Mines de Paris and a Ph.D. in Biochemical
Engineering from École Polytechnique de Montréal. Before joining the National
Research Council in 1991, he was a professor of mass-transport phenomena and
reactor design. His current research activities focus on uncovering mechanisms
associated with cell production of viral vectors and viral vaccines; cell and
metabolic engineering; process control and monitoring; and process analytical
technologies of high yield productions of viral vectors for gene delivery and
vaccination. He published over one hundred and thirty papers in refereed
international journals and acts as consultant for a number of national and
international private and public organizations.

He is currently teaching the following courses:

- [[https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2018-2019/courses/bien-590][BIEN 590: Cell Culture Engineering]]
- [[https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2018-2019/courses/bien-340][BIEN 340: Transport Processes in Biological Systems]]
